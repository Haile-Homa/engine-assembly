## 🏆 Project Highlights  

Welcome to my **Engine Assembly Project**, a comprehensive 3D modeling and mechanical design endeavor completed during my Mechanical Engineering studies at Bahir Dar University. This independent project showcases my proficiency in **SolidWorks**, where I designed, modeled, and assembled all major engine components from scratch. From pistons and crankshafts to connecting rods and engine blocks, this project demonstrates my ability to create precise mechanical assemblies with proper motion and functionality. The half-cut engine model provides excellent visibility into internal mechanisms, highlighting both my technical skills and understanding of engine dynamics. 🔧⚙️
